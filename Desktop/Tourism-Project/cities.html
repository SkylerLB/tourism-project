                        <span>Beirut</span> Beirut, Lebanon's capital and largest city, is a historic Mediterranean hub with over 5,000 years of history. It has a population of 2.2 million and serves as Lebanon's political and economic center, home to major banks and a key seaport. Despite its significance, Beirut suffered heavy damage from the Lebanese Civil War and the 2020 Port explosion, leading to ongoing reconstruction. It is recognized as a Beta + World City.
                        <br><br>
                        Beirut, inhabited for over 5,000 years, has prehistoric roots with archaeological sites in its urban area uncovering flint tools from the Middle Palaeolithic to the Bronze Age, indicating long-term settlement and early human activity. <br> <center><a href="#" id="more1" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">More details about Beirut</a></center>

                            <span class="cityname">Beirut I (Minet el-Hosn)</span> The prehistoric site, known as "the town of Beirut" (French: Beyrouth ville), was identified by Louis Burkhalter near the Avenue des Français in central Beirut. Discovered by Lortet in 1894 and studied by Godefroy Zumoffen in 1900, the site revealed a Mousterian flint industry, with artifacts now housed in the Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon.
                            <br><br>

                            <span class="cityname">Beirut II (Umm el-Khatib)</span> Burkhalter suggested the site was located south of Tarik el Jedideh, where P.E. Gigues uncovered a Copper Age flint industry approximately 100 meters above sea level. However, the site was built over and destroyed by 1948

                            <span class="cityname">Beirut III (Furn esh-Shebbak)</span>, The site, known as Plateau Tabet, was believed to be on the left bank of the Beirut River, west of the Damascus road, though this location has been questioned by Lorraine Copeland. P.E. Gigues discovered Neolithic flint tools and the remains of a possible hut circle there, while Auguste Bergy noted polished axes from the site. However, due to construction and urbanization, the site has been completely lost
                            <br><br>

                            <span class="cityname">Beirut IV (Furn esh-Shebbak, river banks)</span> A smaller site on the left bank of the Beirut River, east of the Furn esh Shebbak police station, was marked by red sand from Quaternary river terraces. Found by Jesuit Father Dillenseger and studied by Jesuits Godefroy Zumoffen, Raoul Describes, and Auguste Bergy, it contained Middle Paleolithic flint tools, including about 50 Acheulean bifaces, some with a glossy sheen, now in the Museum of Lebanese Prehistory. Henri Fleisch also noted an Emireh point. The site has since been lost to urban development.
                            <br><br>

                            <span class="cityname">Beirut V (Nahr Beirut, Beirut River)</span> was discovered by Dillenseger and said to be in an orchard of mulberry trees on the left bank of the river, near the river mouth, and to be close to the railway station and bridge to Tripoli. Levallois flints and bones and similar surface material were found amongst brecciated deposits. The area has now been built on.
                            <br><br>

                            <span class="cityname">Beirut VI (Patriarchate)</span> was a site discovered while building on the property of the Lebanese Evangelical School for Girls in the Patriarchate area of Beirut. It was notable for the discovery of a finely styled Canaanean blade javelin suggested to date to the early or middle Neolithic periods of Byblos and which is held in the school library.
                            <br><br>

                            <span class="cityname">Beirut VII</span>, The Rivoli and Byblos Cinema sites near Bourj, discovered in 1964, revealed collapsed walls, pits, pottery, and flints behind Byblos Cinema. West of Rivoli Cinema, three layers were found: blade fragments in black soil, Bronze Age pottery in grey soil, and Roman pottery and mosaics above. Middle Bronze Age tombs were also uncovered, suggesting the ancient tell of Beirut is in the Bourj area.

                        <span>Byblos</span>The site, called Kebny in Egyptian records from the 4th-dynasty pharaoh Sneferu (fl. 2600 BC) and Gubla in Akkadian Amarna letters to 18th-dynasty pharaohs, later appeared as Gebal in Phoenician, Geval in the Hebrew Bible, and gbl in Syriac. The name, possibly meaning "Well of the God" or "Source of the God," referred to Canaanite deities or their leader.
                        <br><br>
                        The Arabic name *Jibayl* or *Jbeil* (Lebanese pronunciation) derives from earlier names, though it seems influenced by the triliteral root *gbl* or *jbl*, meaning "mountain." In English, the Arabic form is usually written as *Jbeil*, *Jbail*, or *Jbayl*. These, along with *Byblos*, share etymological ties. During the Crusades, the name appeared in European records as *Gibelet* or *Giblet*, referring to Byblos Castle and its lordship.. <br> <center><a href="#" id="more2" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">More details about Byblos</a></center>

                            The ancient Phoenician city of Byblos, known to the Greeks and Romans for its trade in Egyptian papyrus, may have inspired the English word "Bible" through Greek terms like *biblos* and *biblíon*. Located 42 km north of Beirut, Byblos is a key archaeological site due to its layers of human habitation. Excavations began with Ernest Renan in 1860, followed by Pierre Montet and Maurice Dunand, with Renan aiming to prove that Gebeil (modern Jbeil) was indeed the historic Byblos.
                            <br><br>
                            Byblos was first settled during the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period (8800–7000 BC), with Neolithic building remains still visible. According to Philo of Byblos, citing Sanchuniathon, the city was founded by the Phoenician god El, later equated with the Greek god Cronus. By the 3rd millennium BC, a well-organized town emerged, marked by uniform houses, signaling the rise of Canaanite civilization.
                            <br><br>
                            Byblos, along with Lebanon, was under French Mandate from 1920 to 1943 until Lebanon gained independence. The 2006 Lebanon War caused an oil spill that damaged its harbor and town walls, but this has since been cleaned. Today, the coastal area is a popular beach destination in late spring and summer.

                        <span class="cityname">Jounieh</span>Jounieh is a coastal city in Lebanon’s Keserwan District, about 16 km north of Beirut. Since 2017, it has been the capital of Keserwan-Jbeil Governorate. The city is famous for its seaside resorts, nightlife, old souk, ferry port, paragliding site, and gondola lift to the Our Lady of Lebanon shrine in Harissa..
                        <br><br>
                        Above Jounieh, Bkerké is a hill overlooking the bay and serves as the seat of the Maronite Catholic Patriarch. The city's residents are predominantly Maronite Catholics. Historically, Jounieh was noted as a sea fortress by medieval historians, with al-Idrisi mentioning its Jacobite Christian inhabitants and Yaqut al-Hamawi linking it to Tripoli.<br> <center><a href="#" id="more3" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">More details about Jouneih</a></center>
                        <p id="details3" class="hidden">
                            In the mid-19th century, Professor Butrus Al-Boustani described Jounieh as a commercial hub on the Keserwan coast with warehouses, stores, and a dye house. It was known for its grain trade, with ships bringing supplies, and included the villages of Sarba, Ghadir, and Harat Sakhr. With a population of 2,500, Jounieh was not primarily residential but a workplace for people from nearby towns.
                            <br><br>
                            In the late 19th century, Jounieh was connected to neighboring areas by carriage roads and later a railroad to Beirut in 1892, improving trade and transport. By 1876, it had over 300 shops, five silk factories, rest houses, a mill, juice factories, an artificial ice factory, a bank, and small sailboat construction sites. These developments boosted Jounieh’s role as a commercial hub in the Keserwan region.
                            <br><br>
                            By 1906, Jounieh had a population of 2,400 and was a hub for silk production, with multiple factories and 80 carriages. In 1914, neighboring towns like Ghadir, Sarba, Harat Sakhr, and Sahil ‘Alma had thriving commercial activity and growing populations. Jounieh prospered further after France and the Maronite Patriarchy supported the opening of a commercial port, making it an official port of Mount Lebanon alongside Al-Nabi Younes Port.

                        <span class="cityname">Tripoli</span> Tripoli is the largest city in northern Lebanon and the country’s second-largest, located 85 km north of Beirut. Overlooking the Mediterranean, it is Lebanon’s northernmost seaport and includes the country’s only islands, the Palm Islands, a protected haven for endangered wildlife. Tripoli is geographically connected to El Mina, forming the greater Tripoli conurbation.
                        <br><br>
                        Tripoli's history dates back to at least the 14th century BCE and is home to the Mansouri Great Mosque and Lebanon’s largest Crusader fortress, the Citadel of Raymond de Saint-Gilles.

                            In the Arab World, Tripoli is sometimes known as Ṭarābulus al-Sham (Arabic: طرابلس الشام), or Levantine Tripoli, to distinguish it from its Libyan counterpart, known as Tripoli-of-the-West (Arabic: طرابلس الغرب‎; Ṭarābulus al-Gharb).
                            <br><br>
                            With the formation of Lebanon and the 1948 breakup of the Syrian–Lebanese customs union, Tripoli, once on par in economic and commercial importance to Beirut, was cut off from its traditional trade relations with the Syrian hinterland and therefore declined in relative prosperity.
                            <br><br>
                            Tripoli had a number of different names as far back as the Phoenician age. In the Amarna letters the name "Derbly", possibly a Semitic cognate of the city's modern Arabic name Ṭarābulus, was mentioned, and in other places "Ahlia" or "Wahlia" are mentioned (14th century BCE). In an engraving concerning the invasion of Tripoli by the Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II (888–859 BCE), it is called Mahallata or Mahlata, Mayza, and Kayza.
                            <br><br>
                            Under the Phoenicians, the name Athar was used to refer to Tripoli. When the Ancient Greeks settled in the city they called it Τρίπολις (Tripolis), meaning "three cities," influenced by the earlier phonetically similar but etymologically unrelated name Derbly. The Arabs called it Ṭarābulus and Ṭarābulus al-Šām (referring to bilād al-Šām, to distinguish it from the Libyan city with the same name).
                            <br><br>
                            Today, Tripoli is also known as al-fayḥā′ (الفيحاء), which is a term derived from the Arabic verb faha which is used to indicate the diffusion of a scent or smell. Tripoli was once known for its vast orange orchards. During the season of blooming, the pollen of orange flowers was said to be carried on the air, creating a splendid perfume which filled the city and suburbs.

                        <span class="cityname">Sidon</span> known locally as Sayda or Saida (Arabic: صيدا), is the third-largest city in Lebanon. It is located in the South Governorate, of which it is the capital, on the Mediterranean coast. Tyre to the south and Lebanese capital Beirut to the north are both about 40 kilometres (25 miles) away. Sidon has a population of about 80,000 within city limits, while its metropolitan area has more than a quarter-million inhabitants.
                        <br><br>
                        Sidon was one of the most important Phoenician cities, and it may have been the oldest. From there and other ports, a great Mediterranean commercial empire was founded. Homer praised the skill of its craftsmen in producing glass, purple dyes, and its women's skill at the art of embroidery. It was also from here that a colonising party went to found the city of Tyre. Tyre also grew into a great city, and in subsequent years there was competition between the two, each claiming to be the metropolis ('Mother City') of Phoenicia. <br> <center><a href="#" id="more5" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">More details about Saidon</a></center>
                        <p id="details5" class="hidden">
                            Glass manufacturing, Sidon's most important enterprise in the Phoenician era, was conducted on a vast scale, and the production of purple dye was almost as important. The small shell of the Murex trunculus was broken in order to extract the pigment that was so rare it became the mark of royalty.
                            <br><br>
                            In 1855, King Eshmun’azar II's sarcophagus was found, with a Phoenician inscription naming him a 5th-century BC Sidonian king and son of a priestess of ‘Ashtart. The text mentions Eshmun and Ba‘al Sidon as chief gods and refers to ‘Ashtart as ‘Ashtart-Shem-Ba‘al, linking her to Ugaritic texts. This reveals Sidon's religious and cultural ties. 
                            <br><br>
                            Nebuchadnezzar II subjugated the city to be part of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. At the end of the Persian era, in 351 BC, Phoenicia was invaded by Artaxerxes III
                            <br><br>
                            Sidon, like other Phoenician cities, was conquered by the Persian Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BC and later by Alexander the Great in 333 BC, ushering in the Hellenistic era. Persian influence reshaped its architecture, while under Alexander's successors, it enjoyed autonomy and hosted regional games. Key finds from its Hellenistic necropolis, such as the Alexander Sarcophagus, are now in Istanbul's Archaeological Museum.
                            <br><br>
                            After Sidon came under Ottoman Turkish rule in the early 16th century, it became the capital of the Sidon Eyalet (province) and regained a great deal of its earlier commercial importance. Starting in the 18th century the city was dominated by the Hammud family of notables, who monopolized the production and exporting of cotton in the region and built numerous palaces and public works in the city. The Hammuds also served as government customs agents and tax collectors for various Ottoman religious foundations.
                            <br><br>
                            During the Egyptian–Ottoman War, Sidon - like much of Ottoman Syria - was occupied by the forces of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. His ambitions were opposed by the British Empire, which backed the Ottomans. The British Admiral Charles Napier, commanding a mixed squadron of British, Turkish and Austrian ships, bombarded Sidon on 26 September 1840, and landed with the storming column. Sidon capitulated in two days, and the British went on to Acre. This action was recalled in two Royal Navy vessels being named "HMS Sidon".

                        <span class="cityname">Tyre</span> Tyre, a city in Lebanon, is one of the world's oldest continuously inhabited cities, though its population dwindled to a small size during medieval times. As a prominent Phoenician metropolis, it is the legendary birthplace of Europa, Cadmus, Phoenix, and Carthage's founder Dido (Elissa). Renowned for its ancient sites, including the Tyre Hippodrome, the city was entirely designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984, with historian Ernest Renan famously describing it as "a city of ruins, built out of ruins."
                        <br><br>
                        Today Tyre is the fourth largest city in Lebanon after Beirut, Tripoli, and Sidon. It is the capital of the Tyre District in the South Governorate. There were approximately 200,000 inhabitants in the Tyre urban area in 2016, including many refugees, as the city hosts three of the twelve Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon: Burj El Shimali, El Buss, and Rashidieh.<br> <center><a href="#" id="more6" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">More details about Tyre</a></center>

                            Tyre juts out from the coast of the Mediterranean Sea and is located about 80 km (50 mi) south of Beirut. It originally consisted of two distinct urban centres: Tyre itself, which was on an island just offshore, and the associated settlement of Ushu on the adjacent mainland, later called Palaetyrus, meaning "Old Tyre" in Ancient Greek.
                            <br><br>
                            Tyre's rocky islands have historically benefited from abundant fresh water sources, including the Rashidieh and Ras Al Ain springs in the south, Al Bagbog and Ain Ebreen springs in the north, and the Litani River. The modern city of Tyre now covers much of the original island and the causeway built by Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, which has widened over centuries due to silt deposits. The remaining uncovered part of the island is an archaeological site, preserving ancient ruins that highlight Tyre's rich history.
                            <br><br>
                            Tyre's 16.7 km² built-up area is formed by parts of four municipalities: Sour (the city center, excluding the Natural and Coastal Reserve), Burj El Shimali (eastern areas without agricultural lands), Abbasiyet Sour (northern areas excluding farmland and a dislocated village), and Ain Baal (southeastern areas without farmland and dislocated villages). The city lies on a fertile coastal plain, with approximately 44% of its territory used for intra-urban agriculture and over 40% for built-up land as of 2017. This reflects Tyre's unique blend of urban development and agricultural activity.
                            <br><br>
                            In terms of geomorphology and seismicity, Tyre is close to the Roum Fault and the Yammouneh Fault. Though it has suffered a number of devastating earthquakes over the millennia, the threat level is considered to be low in most places and moderate in a few others. However, a tsunami following an earthquake and subsequent landslides and floods pose major natural risks to the Tyrian population.
                            <br><br>
                            Vast reserves of natural gas are estimated to lie beneath Lebanese waters, much of it off Tyre's coast, but exploitation has been delayed by border disputes with Israel.

                        <span class="cityname">Nabatieh</span> Nabatieh is the capital of the Nabatieh Governorate in southern Lebanon. Its population is difficult to determine due to the absence of a census since the 1930s, but estimates vary widely between 15,000 and 120,000. In 2006, the German population site World Gazetteer estimated the population at 100,541, making it the fifth-largest city in Lebanon at that time. However, a revised estimate from 2013 significantly reduced this figure to 36,593, placing Nabatieh as the 11th largest city in Lebanon.
                        The city serves as a key center for the Jabal Amel region, as well as for the Nabatieh Governorate and Kaza district. It holds both economic and cultural significance in the area.
                        <br><br>
                        A market is held every Monday where traders and visitors from neighbouring villages gather in the centre of the town to exchange their goods in an area known in Arabic as the Souq Al Tanen. There are also branches of several banks, hospitals, restaurants and cultural centres of interest to tourists. Every year, the city commemorates the Battle of Karbala to remember the martyrdom of Imam al Husayn.<br> <center><a href="#" id="more7" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">More details about Nabatieh</a></center>

                            Nabatieh was the birthplace of several learned men, including linguist and Arab nationalist leader Ahmad Rida, historian Muhammad Jaber Al Safa, scientist Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah (nephew of Ahmad Rida) and theologian Sheikh Ahmed Aref El-Zein.
                            <br><br>
                            The town's name originates with the Phoenician word meaning “the appearance.”[dubious – discuss] Nabatieh is known for its grottos, the most important of which are the grottos of Ich Al-Ghourab, “the crow’s nest,” and Maghar Mahalah, “the red spot.”[citation needed] Also of interest are some ancient rock tombs, Roman and Byzantine ruins, and two very old mosques.
                            <br><br>
                            In the 1596 tax records, it was named as Nabatiyya al-Tahta, located in the Ottoman nahiya (subdistrict) of Sagif under the liwa' (district) of Safad, with a population of 151 households and 28 bachelors, all Muslim. The villagers paid taxes on goats and beehives, "occasional revenues", a press for olive oil or grape syrup, a market toll, and a fixed sum; a total of 9,030 akçe.
                            <br><br>
                            In 1875, Victor Guérin found Nabatieh et-Tahta ("The lower Nabatieh") to have 1,500 Metuali inhabitants, in addition to 300 Christians; mostly Greek Orthodox, but also some Maronites.
                            <br><br>
                            Following the 1982 invasion and Israel’s withdrawal Nabatieh was on the edge of the so-called security zone. On 24 August 1989 an IAF air strike on Ain Abu Suwar near Nabatieh killed nine people. Reports stated that the dead were refugees from the fighting in Beirut. In early December the same year Nabatieh was shelled for three days by the South Lebanon Army. Four people were killed and eighteen wounded.
                            <br><br>
                            On 17 May 1991 two bombs exploded in Nabatieh killing four people including a member of the South Lebanon Army. A statement from the Islamic Resistance Movement claimed responsibility. Five months later the area around Nabatieh was subjected to eight days of shelling by the SLA and the Israeli Army. The bombardment culminated on 1st November with a series of airstrikes which destroyed two bridges between Nabatieh and Iqlim al Tuffah. The Israeli offensive coincided with the start of the Madrid Peace Conference.

                        <span class="cityname">Baalbek</span> is a city located east of the Litani River in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, about 67 km (42 mi) northeast of Beirut. It is the capital of Baalbek-Hermel Governorate. In Greek and Roman times Baalbek was also known as Heliopolis (Ἡλιούπολις, Greek for "Sun City"). In 1998 Baalbek had a population of 82,608, mostly Shia Muslims, followed by Sunni Muslims and Christians.
                        <br><br>
                        It is home to the Baalbek temple complex which includes two of the largest and grandest Roman temple ruins: the Temple of Bacchus and the Temple of Jupiter. It was inscribed in 1984 as an UNESCO World Heritage site.
                        A few miles from the swamp from which the Litani (the classical Leontes) and the Asi (the upper Orontes) flow, Baalbek may be the same as the manbaa al-nahrayn ("Source of the Two Rivers"), the abode of El in the Ugaritic Baal Cycle discovered in the 1920s and a separate serpent incantation.<br> <center><a href="#" id="more8" style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">More details about Baalbak</a></center>

                            Baalbek, known as Heliopolis in Roman times, means "Sun City" and was home to a major solar cult. The local god Baʿal Haddu was equated with Zeus or Jupiter. The city was sometimes called *Heliopolis Syriaca* to distinguish it from its Egyptian counterpart. Baalbek still features some of the best-preserved Roman ruins in Lebanon, including massive temples dedicated to Jupiter, Venus, and Bacchus, reflecting both Roman and local influences in its design.
                            <br><br>
                            The name bʿlbk is first attested in the Mishnah, a second-century rabbinic text, as a geographic epithet for a kind of garlic, shum ba'albeki (שום בעלבכי). Two early 5th-century Syriac manuscripts, a c. 411 translation of Eusebius's Theophania and a c. 435 life of Rabbula, bishop of Edessa. It was pronounced as Baʿlabakk (Arabic: بَعْلَبَكّ) in Classical Arabic. In Modern Standard Arabic, its vowels are marked as Baʿlabak (بَعْلَبَك) or Baʿlabekk.[26] It is Bʿalbik (بْعَلْبِك, is [ˈbʕalbik]) in Lebanese Arabic.
                            <br><br>
                            The etymology of Baalbek has been debated indecisively since the 18th century. Cook took it to mean "Baʿal (Lord) of the Beka" and Donne as "City of the Sun". Lendering asserts that it is probably a contraction of Baʿal Nebeq ("Lord of the Source" of the Litani River). Steiner proposes a Semitic adaption of "Lord Bacchus", from the classical temple complex.
                            <br><br>
                            On the basis of its similar name, several 19th-century Biblical archaeologists attempted to connect Baalbek to the "Baalgad" mentioned in the Hebrew Scripture's Book of Joshua, the Baalath listed among Solomon's cities in the First Book of Kings, the Baal-hamon where he had a vineyard, and the "Plain of Aven" in Amos.
