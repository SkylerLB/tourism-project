                  <dd>Making great kibbeh is an art form, and can take a lot of practise to get just right. You have to make sure the kibbeh is crunchy but not too dry. The casing has to be thin but still substantial enough to balance the filling. The filling should complement the casing without overwhelming it. When you bite a kibbeh it should be savoury and moderately spiced, never too spicy or bland.</dd>

                <dd>Baba ghanouj or ghanoush, or moutabal are just some of the many names this dip is known by. I will not get too deep into the debate but in Lebanon, this dip is almost always known as moutabal. Traditionally, “baba ghanouj” is a Levantine eggplant dish similar to moutabal but, with no tahini. However, globally, baba ghanouj has taken over the name of moutabal for this smokey eggplant dish</dd>

Sambousek is very similar to fatayer, except the dough is a little different as it is not baked, but rather fried. Also, unlike Lahme bi Ajeen, the open-faced meat pies, the beef in sambousek is precooked before being rolled up.</dd>

But anyone who’s tried Tabbouleh Salad knows what a fresh, delightful and tasty salad it is! Along with fattoush salad, it’s the top salad served in Lebanon, where my parents are from. So, as you can imagine, I’ve grown up eating a lot of tabbouleh in my life. And I’ve grown to learn how to make the best tabbouleh recipe!</dd>

          <h1>ABOUT MEZZA</h1>
          <div class="aboutUsText">
            In Lebanon and Cyprus, meze is often a meal in its own right. There are vegetarian, meat or fish mezes. Groups of dishes arrive at the table about 4 or 5 at a time (usually between five and ten groups). There is a set pattern to the dishes: typically olives, tahini, salad and yogurt will be followed by dishes with vegetables and eggs, then small meat or fish dishes alongside special accompaniments, and finally more substantial dishes such as whole fish or meat stews and grills. Establishments will offer their own specialities, but the pattern remains the same. Naturally the dishes served will reflect the seasons. For example, in late autumn, snails will be prominent. As so much food is offered, it is not expected that every dish be finished, but rather shared at will and served at ease. Eating meze is a social event.
