                        Downtown Beirut is the central district of Beirut, with its outdoor cafes restaurants and high end designer stores.
                        <br>
                        The inner area around Nejmeh Square is pedestrian-only. Ashrafieh is to its East, while Hamra, Ras Beirut, Manara and Rawcheh to its West.
                        <br>
                        Getting to downtown from other parts of Beirut or one of the bus stations is easy. Simple hop in any taxi/Service and ask for either "Downtown" or "Solidere"
                        <br>
                        Navigating around Downtown can be tricky, as people often rely on landmarks rather than street numbers. It's important to familiarize yourself with key landmarks in the area. Using a geolocation service like PinLiban can help you track and note exact locations. Fortunately, Downtown is compact and can easily be explored on foot.

                      Hamra Street (Arabic: شارع الحمراء) is a major thoroughfare in Beirut, Lebanon, located in the Hamra neighborhood. Known as one of Beirut’s primary economic and diplomatic hubs, it was historically the center of intellectual activity in the 1960s and 1970s, thanks to its many sidewalk cafes and theaters. Before 1975, it was considered the trendiest area in the city. 
                      However, in the post-war period, other areas like Rue Monot, Rue Gouraud, and Rue Verdun have gained more prominence. In the mid-1990s, the Municipality of Beirut revitalized Hamra Street to attract tourists throughout the year. It was once dubbed Beirut's "Champs Elysées," popular with tourists, particularly Americans, Europeans, and wealthy Arabs.
                      Hamra lies directly on the West of Downtown Beirut. Hail a taxi or walk to the short distance.<br>
                      Expect traffic jam from 9am to 9pm, so let your taxi or your van drop you at the entrance of the area, and keep walking!<br>

											 North Forest, much of which is a nature reserve. Located at the extreme end of the Mount Lebanon range in the Akkar area, Qamouaa is considered an important tourist centre.
                        The surrounding heights rise to 2,454 meters and there are forests that are remarkable because of the abundance of such trees as junipers, hairy oaks,
                       cypresses, cedars and Cilician firs. Judging by the cedars to be found there, geologists say that these historic forests are at least a thousand years old. The plains of Qamoua
                        lie at 1,450 metres altitude in a sort of depression between the mountains.

											 Qammoua is the most important forest region of Lebanon. It covers 30 kilometers by 25, from the valley of Wadi Gehanam to the sources of Kobbayat, and from the source of Fnaydik to
                       that of the Nassarahs of Koubayat. This forest has more than 10 million trees of fifty different species, the most important of these including the junipers, cedars, and Cilician firs.

											 The forest has suffered considerable damage throughout its history, first of all at the hands of the British, who cut down a great number of the trees in order to use their trunks as
                       sleepers under the railway linking Lebanon’s North and South.                     </p>

During this meeting, the Lebanese Parliament agreed on the *Taaif Agreement*, a pivotal accord aimed at ending the Civil War and improving Lebanon's relationships with its neighboring countries. The Taaif Agreement played a key role in the political and social reconstruction of Lebanon after the conflict.

                        Baalbek is a city located east of the Litani River in Lebanon's Beqaa Valley, about 67 km northeast of Beirut. It is the capital of Baalbek-Hermel Governorate.
                        In Greek and Roman times Baalbek was also known as Heliopolis. In 1998 Baalbek had a population of 82,608, mostly Shia Muslims, followed by Sunni Muslims and Christians.
                        <br>
                        The Ancient Aliens show suggests that the ruins at Baalbek, specifically in the Bar Car Valley of eastern Lebanon, go beyond their well-known Roman and Greek architecture, such as the grand temples built to honor gods like Zeus. The site is believed by archaeologists to be over 9,000 years old, originally sacred to the Canaanite god Baal. However, the show takes this a step further, proposing that the massive stone foundation beneath the Roman structures might have been used as a platform for space travelers, speculating that it could have been a landing pad for ancient extraterrestrial visitors. This theory ties into the broader narrative of ancient astronaut theorists, who believe that the advanced technology and monumental scale of ancient structures like Baalbek may indicate extraterrestrial influence.

										 <p class="tourism">
                      Ms. Khawla's shrine in Baalbek is a significant religious site for Muslims and an important part of religious tourism in the region. It attracts pilgrims seeking blessings, prayers, and spiritual connection. The questions surrounding the shrine's location in Baalbek—why Ms. Khawla's grave is situated there and what brought her to the Bekaa Valley—are part of its historical and religious mystique.

According to historical accounts, after the martyrdom of Imam Hussein in Karbala, his sisters, daughters, and women of his family endured a long and arduous journey from Karbala to Kufa and then to Damascus. As part of this journey, they passed through several regions, including Aleppo, Hama, and Homs, eventually reaching Lebanon. It is believed that Ms. Khawla, along with the other women and family members of Imam Hussein, passed through Baalbek and Marja Ras al-Ain, where the Ras Imam Hussein Mosque is located.

The discovery of the shrine and its significance to religious tourism raises questions about its historical context and the state's involvement in promoting it, especially given its role in attracting pilgrims.

                      The Beqaa Valley, located in eastern Lebanon, is the country's most important farming region. Stretching 120 kilometers (75 miles) long and 16 kilometers (9.9 miles) wide, it lies between Mount Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon mountains. Known for its Mediterranean climate, the valley experiences snowy winters and dry, warm summers. Rainfall is limited due to the rain shadow effect from Mount Lebanon. Two major rivers, the Orontes and the Litani, originate in the valley, with the Litani flowing into the Mediterranean Sea. The region also has a significant agricultural industry.

                      Afqa Waterfall is located in the Jbeil District of the Mount Lebanon, 71 kilometres northeast of Beirut.

                      Afqa waterfall is one of the finest waterfalls in the mountains of the Middle East, which feeds into the Adonis River (known today as Abraham River or Nahr Ibrahim in Arabic).

                      The best time to visit the water fall is late winter and early spring.<br>
                      This impressive 72m waterfall was the lone waterfall we encountered on our Kenyan safari.

                      Unfortunately, I also suffered from a pretty bad case of food poisoning, which kept us from going down to the bottom.

                      Nevertheless, with waterfalls like this in a country where big game safaris rule most of the tourism traffic, we found it refreshing to mix things up a bit.

                      And this kind of waterfall certainly had legitimate size and flow to hopefully find more like it on a future trip.

In contrast, its moderate and dry summers make it a popular retreat for Lebanese residents escaping the coastal humidity. The village is also a favored summer destination for Arab tourists due to its peaceful atmosphere and pleasant climate.

                      According to historian Boutros Béchara Karam, the Naamtallah Néhmé family originally resided in Rishtaamout before moving to Houmeis, a ruined village within present-day Miziara. With permission from the Shiite Hamadeh rulers of Jebbet Bsharri, the family settled in the area, which they found particularly appealing. Youssef, son of Naamtallah Néhmé, is regarded as the founder of Miziara, as documented by historians..

                        Nabatieh, also spelled Nabatîyé, is the capital of the Nabatieh Governorate in southern Lebanon. It serves as a vital economic and cultural center for the Jabal Amel region. While Lebanon has not conducted an official census since the 1930s, population estimates for Nabatieh have varied widely. A 2006 estimate suggested a population of around 100,541, making it one of Lebanon’s largest cities at the time. However, later estimates in 2013 placed the population at approximately 36,593, ranking it as the 11th largest city in the country.  
                        
                        Despite fluctuations in population estimates, Nabatieh remains a crucial administrative, economic, and cultural hub. It is known for its active markets, historical significance, and vibrant local traditions..

Mount Hermon, also known as Jabal El Haramoun or Jabal El Sheikh, is the highest peak in the Anti-Lebanon mountain range, spanning Lebanon, Syria, and the Israeli-Palestinian territories. Revered since antiquity, the mountain is home to numerous archaeological sites and religious landmarks.  

With over 70 biblical references, Mount Hermon holds deep spiritual significance. Some traditions suggest that Jesus Christ’s transfiguration took place atop this mountain. Today, despite geopolitical challenges, the western Lebanese slopes of Mount Hermon continue to be a site for religious pilgrimages and interfaith rituals, reflecting the region’s diverse religious heritage. The shared spiritual reverence for Mount Hermon fosters inter-sectarian connections, reinforcing its role in both local and national identity.

                       about 1 kilometre (0.62 mi) to the south-south-east of the village of Arnoun. There was a fortification on the site before it was captured by Fulk, King of Jerusalem, in 1139 and construction of the
                        Crusader castle probably began soon after. Saladin captured Beaufort in 1190, but 60 years later Crusaders re-took it. In 1268 Sultan Baibars finally captured the castle for the Islamic forces.

                      Beaufort provides one of the few cases in which a medieval castle proved of military value and utility in modern warfare as well, as its late 20th-century history shows.

                        Historically, Naqoura was described by 19th-century travelers such as Victor Guérin, who noted its fertile landscape, ancient ruins, and a thriving community of around 400 Metawileh. The village, situated near the historic Ladder of the Tyrians, was known for its olive groves, fig trees, and palm gardens. The 1881 Survey of Western Palestine also highlighted its abundant water sources and agricultural wealth.  
                        
                        Today, Naqoura remains a key location due to its proximity to the Lebanese-Israeli border and its role in regional peacekeeping efforts.
