              Lebanon is a small, war-torn country on the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
              Located on fertile territory at the crossroads of three continents—Africa, Asia, and Europe—it
              is a valuable and highly desired territory.
              Throughout its history, it has been the stage for conflicts between local tribes-people and world powers.
              After being ruled by the Ottoman Empire and by the French, Lebanon gained full independence in 1943.</h3>
